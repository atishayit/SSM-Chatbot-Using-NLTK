Chat – Chat is a class that contains complete logic for processing the text data which the chatbot receives and find useful information out of it.
Reflections – Another import we have done is reflections which is a dictionary containing basic input and corresponding outputs. 

After creating pairs of rules, we will define a function to initiate the chat process. The function is very simple which first greet the user, and ask for any help. And the conversation starts from here by calling a Chat class and passing pairs and reflections to it.
